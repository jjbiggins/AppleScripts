--- converts jpg images to png
--- the script removes 3 letter file extensions, so it should work with any image files fitting that criteria (tested with bmp and jpg).
--- general use: select a jpg file in finder, run the script, the script makes a copy of the file as png, saves to same dir as orignal file. 
--- my use: saved as an application and added to the finder toolbar (it doesn't want to work as a service, for some reason)

set pathFile to selection as alias
set pathFile to quoted form of POSIX path of pathFile

set destFolder to do shell script "dirname " & pathFile
set baseName to do shell script "basename " & pathFile
set baseName to text 1 thru -5 of baseName


set destFile to destFolder & "/" & baseName & ".png"
set destFile to quoted form of destFolder

do shell script "sips -s format png " & pathFile & " --out " & destFile
