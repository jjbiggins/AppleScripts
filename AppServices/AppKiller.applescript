--- Like app launcher, but just kills apps
--- bind to a key combo for max efficiency 
--- enter app name and press the enter button on your keyboard or press the Go button
--- hit the enter button if you don't want to kill anything
--- added a way to find the process ID of hung applications and force quit using the "kill -KILL" command. 
---	may not work with applications that have many similarly named processes running (like "Google Chrome Helper" or "Google Chrome Renderer")

activate
set applaunch to text returned of (display dialog "" default answer "" buttons {"Go"} default button "Go")
if applaunch contains "" then
	error number -128
else if applaunch contains applaunch then
	try
		tell application applaunch
			quit
		end tell
	on error
		tell application "System Events"
			set {procesList, pidList} to the {name, unix id} of (every process whose name contains applaunch)
			if procesList contains applaunch then
				do shell script "kill -KILL " & pidList
			end if
		end tell
	end try
end if
