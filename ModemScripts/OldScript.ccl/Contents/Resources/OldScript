! OldScript (inside of OldScript.ccl)

! implicitly overrides OldScript
! If OldScript.ccl and OldScript are installed, Other/OldScript won't show
! in the UI.  Replacement Example also overrides OldScript using the explicit
! Supersedes property.  There are two ways to supersede an old script:
! explicitly via the Superseds key in the personality and implicity by
! having the same basename for the containing bundle.
